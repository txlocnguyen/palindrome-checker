Using JavaScript to build a function that return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

Some sample tests:
```

"eye" should return true.

"_eye" should return true.

"race car" should return true.

"not a palindrome" should return false.

"A man, a plan, a canal. Panama" should return true.

"never odd or even" should return true.

"nope" should return false.

"almostomla" should return false.

"My age is 0, 0 si ega ym." should return true.

"1 eye for of 1 eye." should return false.

"0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0" should return true.

"five|\_/|four" should return false.
```
